# GAPses: 
## GAP9 based smart glasses for EEG and EOG acquisition and processing

![Overview](documents/images/main.png)

# Introduction

This repository contains the work in progress on the GAPses project.

GAPses are a pair of smart glasses for comfortable and fully dry acquisition and processing of EEG and EOG. The glasses are suitable for extended wear and various biopotential-based applications, including Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), biometric subject recognition, and real-time EEG/EOG analysis.



### Key Features
- **Lightweight & Comfortable**: The fully assembled glasses weigh only 40g and support unobtrusive, all-day wear.
- **Fully Dry Electrodes**: Custom soft electrodes provide stable contact without skin preparation.
- **Sleek Frame Design**: A sleek frame that discreetly houses electrodes and PCBs, ensuring a secure, comfortable fit for daily use.
- **Secure HMI Demonstration**: GAPses showcases a two-step Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) use case, where EEG-based biometric recognition (BrainMetrics) unlocks the device, followed by EOG-based HMI with a high information transfer rate.
- **End-to-End Edge Implementation**: The entire HMI use case, from BrainMetrics to EOG-based interactions, is processed on-device with GAP9â€™s ultra-low-power capabilities, enabling continuous, privacy-preserving operation on the edge.

## System Diagram

The GAPses system comprises several key components:
- **BioGAP Acquisition and Processing Platform**: This platform enables real-time EEG and EOG data acquisition, processing, and classification on the edge with ultra-low power consumption using the GAP9 RISC-V processor.
- **Electrode Interface PCB**: A flex-rigid PCB embedded in the frame with active signal buffering stages and a direct PCB to electrode interface, reducing interference and artifacts.
- **Channel-Selection Interface PCB**: Allows users to switch between EEG-only and combined EEG-EOG configurations, optimizing channel selection for different use cases.
